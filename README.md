changes colors of icons of halos to more black and white  part of Black  Code Book Project

what?  change colors in squeak halos
when?  anytime
where?  look at the methodName below 
who?  for all
why?    sometimes like windows to more black colors and some white as well.   Part of the black code book project.  

Also if you want to customize to what you want.   its nice to see how the squeak team laid this out.

So to test you need to load the icon  halo type in the preferences  under halo   .   hit load to make it happen it should.
